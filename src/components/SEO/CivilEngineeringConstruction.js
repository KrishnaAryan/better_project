            <h3>What is Civil Engineering Construction?</h3>
            Civil engineering construction is concerned with the planning, construction, and maintenance of
            the physical and naturally constructed environment. Bridges, dams, highways, airports, canals, and
            buildings are all examples of civil construction. Civil engineering is one of the oldest
            engineering fields. It has always been a part of life for humans since the dawn of time. Civil and
            Structural engineering is one of the most important components of civil construction. It aids in
            the construction of structures so that they may properly support themselves while resisting loads.
            The design's stability will serve as the basic civil engineering. There are many large civil
            engineering and architecture projects in today's world. Civil engineering architecture has
            developed all of the infrastructure that we use in our daily lives. Civil engineering is
            responsible for the construction of highways, railways, houses, schools, and other structures.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Civil Engineers and their roles :-</b>
            <br />
            Civil engineers are the people in charge of overseeing construction projects. They are in charge
            of designing the project they have been given, whether it is a transportation project, a water or
            sewerage system project, or something else entirely. Before the structures are ready for public
            use, they plan, design, and test them. Making architectural drawings is the first step, followed
            by selecting materials for the project, and then working on the design. They must consider not
            only the structure of the project, but also how it will affect the surrounding environment. They
            must create a building that is cost-effective, safe, and environmentally sound for a certain
            project. Civil engineers are also in charge of some site preparation tasks. Excavation, grading
            major projects, and even earth shifting are examples. They must also assess and oversee the
            initiatives.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>What are Civil Designers?</b>
            <br />
            Civil Designers produce plans for municipal infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges.
            From basic road and traffic management to wastewater facilities and erosion control systems. They
            work on a variety of infrastructure projects.
