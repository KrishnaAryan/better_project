          construction under a certain budget. There are various easy house construction methods to prevent
          the excess time for building. An interesting aspect which has been seen in numerous houses is
          modular construction. It gives a simple geometric look to your home by pre-manufactured building
          modules to reduce excessive construction time. In this method the construction section takes place
          away from the main site, then delivers the modules to the intended construction site. And the
          installation of modules is completed on the main side. In general, there are three main construction
          materials associated with this method. The materials are wood, steel and cement. This method tends
          to create a custom-built home that follows extremely complex designs or simpler ones. In our
          country, more people are attracted towards the masonry method which is a time taking process under
          certain circumstances like bad weather. But when the weather is in favour this method tends to be

          labour cost, material cost, finishing cost, etc. The estimated amount depends on the method of home
          construction. It should be provided by the construction company to give a proper view of the new
          home construction budget to the client.
