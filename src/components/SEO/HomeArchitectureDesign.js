          <h3>WHAT IS HOME ARCHITECTURE DESIGN?</h3>
          <p>
            Home architecture design is a process which focuses on covering and meeting the needs and demands
            to create a living space. It is done by using certain tools and most importantly creativity. It
            aims to mix the technological and aesthetic vision to your house. In general, we relate
            architecture with drawings, sketches or outlines of a project. And it is also one of its
            fundamental factors. But there are also other factors involved which are associated with geometry,
            space and aesthetics. Therefore, home architecture design is made up of various elements and
            processes. While designing, the architect must take into account that he or she should execute an
            analysis, to design and build according to the needs and resources. They should always keep in
            mind the aesthetics and technical characteristics, as well as the basic rules of construction.
            That is why the process of identifying all these variables must consider that it is necessary to
            reflect the needs, both artistically and technically on the paper as well as in software. The
            lines are the main element of the architectural design, which define several aspects such as the
            shape, dimension and position of the different spaces merging the project.
