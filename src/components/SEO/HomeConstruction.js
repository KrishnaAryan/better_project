          <h3>WHAT IS HOME CONSTRUCTION?</h3>
          <p>
            Home Construction refers to the process of constructing a house. We generally call a house as a
            "home" when people might live over there today or some other day. From the pre-historic period to
            the 21st century, the techniques of house construction have developed from scratch to modern
            equipment. In today's world, there's a lot more advancement in the process of building a house.
            And with the different levels of wealth and standard, people prefer various sizes and luxuries at
            home. Cultural aspects and environmental factors have played a key role in the creation of a
            diverse collection of architectural designs. Home Construction Companies have the responsibility
            to look before the primary trade as well as secondary trades involved in home construction,
            namely, carpenters, masons, electricians, plumbers, interior designers, etc..

          <h3>METHODS OF HOME CONSTRUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            Before commencing a house construction, there is a list of available construction methods which
            come across our minds. Let's get to know the various methods and basics behind the most common
            construction method :-{" "}
            <ol className="seo-list">
              <li>
                <b>Masonry</b> - Masonry is a process of construction by building structures from single units
                that are laid and fixed together with mortar. The whole process of masonry consists of bricks,
                stones, concrete blocks and cements. It's a physically demanding method. A person who
                constructs through this method is known as Mason. It's a popular construction method around
                the world because of its several advantages in the long run. There are three types of Masonry
                :
                <ul className="seo-list">
                  <li>Brick Masonry</li>
                  <li>Stone Masonry</li>
                  <li>Concrete Blocks Masonry</li>
                </ul>
                Most home construction companies take this method for constructing a new home because of its
                several benefits.
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                <b>Traditional Stick Framing</b> - Traditional Stick Framing is a process of home construction
                in which workers assemble the main structure of your home. In this process, workers start with
                assembling wall studs, floors and ceiling joists and roof trusses stick by stick usually on
                the construction site. Then eventually, they add another story with the base floor adding in
                the roof framing. Basically, wooden sticks and wooden slides are considered in this method.
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                <b>Light Gauge Steel Framing</b> - Light Gauge Steel Framing is a method which involves
                construction in a similar way as Traditional Stick Framing. But instead of wooden sticks to
                design a home, it prefers materials made up of metal. Steel having a high rate of durability
                can last longer than any kind of wooden frame. There is a very less chance for things like
                drywall cracks, shrinking, wrapping, etc. in this method. This method is also a bit expensive
                but more durable.
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                <b>Modular Homes</b> - Modular Home is a prefabricated construction which consists of repeated
                sections known as modules. In this method the construction section takes place away from the
                main site, then delivers the modules to the intended construction site. And the installation
                of modules is completed on the main side. In general, there are three main construction
                materials associated with this method. The materials are wood, steel and cement. This method
                tends to create a custom-built home that follows extremely complex designs or simpler ones.
