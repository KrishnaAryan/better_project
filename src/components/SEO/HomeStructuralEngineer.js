          <h3>What is the structural engineer?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            Structural engineers are civil engineers that are in charge of infrastructure projects in both the
            public and private sectors. Roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and water supply
            and sewage treatment systems are examples of such undertakings. Civil engineering is divided into
            several sub-disciplines, including construction engineering, traffic engineering, water/wastewater
            engineering, and environmental engineering. Civil engineering offers a wide range of
            specialisation options. The education of structural engineers is largely focused on good
            construction design, ensuring that all loads and pressures are accounted for on the construction
            plans. They can be found working on any project involving the construction of existing or proposed
            structures. Many structural engineers work in the house engineering area, dealing with structures
            such as single-family homes, multi-family homes, condos and townhomes, barns, sheds, and
            commercial structures.

            The following are the types of projects that a structural engineer work on:-

          <h3>Who is a Home Structural Engineer? </h3>
          <p>
            Home Structural Engineer is a professional who studies and builds the structural support systems
            for buildings and houses. This is accomplished by assessing gravity supports and lateral force
            resistance before building the structure. A structural engineer, in latent terms, devises the
            strategy for ensuring that a building or structure stands the test of time and does not collapse.
            Many clients are unaware that a structural engineer for house construction is required until it is
            requested by a city official or another expert. So, where does a structural engineer come into
            play? A home structural engineer is typically required whenever there are structural changes made
            to an existing structure or when a new structure is being designed. Let's imagine a homeowner
            wants to add a room to their house or wants to knock down a load-bearing wall to create a place
            for a kitchen or a great room. The appropriate line of action will be determined by the project's
            magnitude. A plan from an architect or designer is required for major renovations or extensions,
            but a modest renovation may skip this step entirely. However both minor and major renovations
            almost always necessitate the services of a home structural engineer. It's critical that your
            structural engineer is knowledgeable about all areas of building construction, including thermal
            technology, whole-house performance, and structural components.
