        <h2>HOUSE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            In any construction project, there are three main parties, a client, management team and a
            contractor. A construction contractor is a party whose responsibility is to look after a
            construction project and is in the prime contact with the property owner. Any construction company
            hires a contractor through the bidding process. In general terms, a contractor is responsible for
            planning, leading, supervising and executing the construction project. He is also responsible for
            inspection of the building construction project.

                given schedule. This schedule has a completion date which the contractors have to meet.
                Otherwise they will have to pay a huge penalty for missing the deadline. The delayed project
                can only be justified due to external factors such as bad weather or extreme weather. The
                following responsibilities a contractor include while creating a project plan:
