        <h2>LOW COST HOME CONSTRUCTION</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            India is a country where half of the population is made up of middle-class families whose greatest
            ambition is to own a home. However, with the current shaky economy, land costs, labour expenses,
            and building material prices have all risen dramatically. As a result, realising their dream of
            owning a home is becoming increasingly difficult. Low-cost home construction refers to house
            construction units that are affordable to those whose income falls below the median household
            income. This is determined by three important factors: income level, dwelling unit size, and
            affordability.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For such families to create the house of their dreams without sacrificing quality, here are some
            cost-effective tips for your dream :-{" "}
          </p>
          <ul className="seo-list">
            <li>
              <b>Pallets for Walls -</b> Wooden pallets have gained popularity in recent years as an
              environmentally friendly alternative to regular wood cladding on walls. They have the advantage
              of matching traditional and contemporary homes alike, in addition to being cost effective for a
              low budget house construction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Masonry Furniture -</b> Whether you're building a bar counter inside or fixed seating
              outside, masonry furniture made of bricks, stones, or cement is not only cost-effective but also
              long-lasting. It's a particularly good option for outdoor furniture that will be exposed to the
              outdoors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Exposed Brick Finish -</b> Exposed brick not only adds warmth to the home's ambiance, but it
              also eliminates the cost of plastering and painting the walls. This is also an option when
              renovating, as you can remove plaster and use open brick treatment on walls to give your home a
              rustic feel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Recycled Wood -</b> There is no need to utilise newly sourced wood when using recycled wood
              because it extends the life of the wood. Wood buildings may be easily altered or disassembled
              and reused after decades or even centuries of use, allowing them to store carbon eternally.
              People want to use salvaged wood in their new custom homes for a variety of reasons. The wood is
              eco-friendly and fits nicely with the "reduce, reuse, recycle" mentality for individuals
              concerned about sustainability. The roughness and weathering give the material a depth and
              character that is impossible to achieve with new materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Concrete Blocks -</b> Concrete blocks are increasingly being used to replace bricks in
              masonry construction, particularly in multi-story buildings. You may make your own lego-style
              house out of ready-made concrete blocks. They're a low-cost option that's also straightforward
              to put together. Budget home builders mainly prefer concrete blocks for construction purposes.
