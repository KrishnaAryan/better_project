        <h2>REVIEWED CONTRACTORS</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            A client, a management team, and a contractor are the three main parties in any construction
            project. A construction contractor is a person tasked with overseeing a construction project and
            serving as the primary point of contact with the property owner. A contractor is hired by a
            construction company through a bidding process. A contractor is in charge of designing, leading,
            supervising, and completing a construction project in general. He is also in charge of the
            building construction project's inspection.

          <h3>RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CONTRACTOR</h3>
          <p>
            As previously said, a contractor has a variety of tasks that vary depending on the contract.
            During a building project, a contractor has a variety of responsibilities.
            <ul className="seo-list">
              <li>
                Project planning is the process of determining how to finish a project within a specified time
                frame. This timetable contains a deadline that the contractors must adhere to. They will have
                to pay a hefty penalty if they miss the deadline. Only external causes, such as terrible
                weather or harsh weather, can justify the project's delay.
              </li>
              <li>
                Project Management: In order to complete the project on time, the contractor engages in the
                following construction management activities:
                <ul className="seo-list">
                  <li>Assuring that funds are available to keep the project going.</li>
                  <li>Purchasing supplies with sufficient forethought.</li>
                  <li>The construction project necessitates the rental of equipment.</li>
                  <li>Subcontractors are hired to complete the specialist task.</li>
                  <li>Creating progress reports with payment information.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Project tracking is critical for completing the project according to the contract's timeline
                and parameters. While tracking the job, the contractor should avoid causing any disruption.
                Several activities are included in this:
                <ul className="seo-list">
                  <li>Controlling the quality.</li>

                  <li>Keeping a steady supply of materials on hand.</li>
                  <li>
                    During construction, the contractor is in charge of project tracking and change
                    management.
                  </li>
